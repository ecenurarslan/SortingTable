 This single page application has a server an an html file as client. Node.js was used for backend and jquery for frontend. 
 I chose to use socket.io for server-client communication. To run the server in your computer, you have to have the node.js installed.

 First, you should start the server by running server.js file in js folder typing "node PATHTOFILE/server.js" in your terminal.
 Then you can simply acces the application by going to localhost:3000 in your browser.
